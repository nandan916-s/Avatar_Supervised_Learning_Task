# Avatar_Supervised_Learning_Task
This Problem mainly deals with Supervised Learning.
we are provided with an intresting dataset(Titanic.csv) which was provided in KAGGLE as a Hackathon question 

My approach to solve this question is through the follwing ways:-
  
  1. Gathering Data
  
  
  2. Data Pre-processing :- Describe is a good command to get to know the data in a summarized way.This is a case of supervised learning in which the model needs inputs and output                             to learn. Well in this case ‘Survived’ Column is output column and rest all are input columns.
      2.1 Data Preparation
      2.2 Cleaning of data
      2.3 Train/Test Split to prevent overfitting :- We split our data into a train set and a cross-validation set. The training set is used to train the machine learning                                                              algorithm.
  
  
  3. Choosing and training a model
      3.1 Random Forest Model :- Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees                                    on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.
      3.2 Logistic Regression :- Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method used to predict a data value based on prior observations of a data set. A logistic regression                                  model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.
   
  
  
  4.Evaluating Model :- we can check how accurate our algorithm is on cross-validation data
   
  
  5.Prediction
